# Mapping Earthquakes

***Overview***

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days using the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude has a larger diameter and a darker color. In addition, each earthquake has a popup marker that, when clicked, shows the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

My approach was to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Then I used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
